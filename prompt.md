I have a merge conflict in `src/ui/pages/results.py` when merging main branch into comparison-prompts branch.
The comparison-prompt branch implement a new feature that add brand and product comparison prompts to enhence the sentiment analysis.
The user can optionally input competitor brands he wants to compare the primary brand with and input comparison prompts.
All this is optional and if the user does input less than 20 prompt the system generates 20 - # prompt user input. 
The conflict result page needs to solve by putting the new sentiment part into a separate tab in needed like "Competitive Landscape", "Performance Analysis" etc.
Can you check how to resolve the conflict without changing the main branch behaviour and with adding the new feature?
